## üìã Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority

#### 1. Update `SYNC-MODE-FAQ.md` (End-User Guide)
**Current Status:** Partially outdated  
**Recommended Updates:**
- Add clear "How to..." sections for common tasks
- Update mode descriptions with user-friendly language
- Add troubleshooting flowcharts
- Include real-world collaboration scenarios
- Add screenshots of UI elements
- Expand Q&A section with common issues

**Suggested Structure:**
```markdown
# Sync Mode - User Guide

## Quick Start
- How do I enable Sync mode?
- How do I become Master?
- How do I go offline?

## Understanding the Three Modes
- Offline (When to use it)
- Sync - Read-Only (When to use it)
- Master - Read-Write (When to use it)

## Working with Others
- How multiple users can collaborate
- Understanding field locks and "User editing" indicators
- What happens when two people edit the same field
- Manual sync button (Master only)

## Troubleshooting
- Why can't I edit? (You're in Sync mode)
- Why don't I see changes from others? (Check your mode)
- Field shows "User editing" - what does it mean?
- My typing gets overwritten immediately

## FAQ
- Can multiple people be Master at the same time? (Yes!)
- Will I lose my changes if someone else edits? (No, conflicts resolved automatically)
- ...
```

#### 2. Update Embedded FAQ in `index.html`
**Location:** Line 3360-3381 (`<script type="text/markdown" id="faqMdSyncEmbedded">`)  
**Current Status:** Minimal (12 lines)  
**Recommended Updates:**
- Expand to 50-100 lines
- Cover all three modes with examples
- Add switching instructions
- Include multi-user collaboration basics
- Add "Common Issues" section

**Suggested Content:**
```markdown
# Sync Mode ‚Äì Quick Guide

## Three Modes

### Offline Mode
- **What it does**: Works locally only
- **When to use**: No internet or working solo
- **How to enable**: Turn both Read and Write OFF

### Sync Mode (Read-Only)
- **What it does**: Sees updates from others, cannot edit
- **When to use**: Monitoring or observing
- **How to enable**: Read ON, Write OFF

### Master Mode
- **What it does**: Full read and write access
- **When to use**: Making changes
- **How to enable**: Write ON (Read stays ON automatically)

## Switching Modes
1. Click the Sync icon in the sidebar
2. Select your mode from the dropdown
3. Changes apply immediately

## Multiple Masters
- Yes, multiple people can be Master
- Field locks show "User editing ‚Ä¢ 3m" when someone is typing
- System automatically resolves conflicts
- Recent edits are protected for 15 seconds

## Troubleshooting
- **Can't edit?** ‚Üí You're in Sync (read-only). Switch to Master.
- **Don't see others' changes?** ‚Üí Check you're in Sync or Master mode.
- **See "User editing"?** ‚Üí Someone else is working on that field. Wait or edit another field.
```

## üóëÔ∏è Legacy Debug Files to Remove

After reviewing `/debug/` folder, the following files are **OUTDATED** and can be safely deleted:

### Deletable Files:

1. **`SYNC_ISSUE_FIX.md`** - Documents project-ID sharing mechanism that was removed. Superseded by new mode system.

2. **`SYNC_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Implementation notes from 2025-09 transition. Now superseded by `SYNC-FUNCTION-DESIGN.md` and `SYNC-CODE-REVIEW.md`.

3. **`MASTER_SLAVE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Original master/slave implementation notes. Terminology and details now outdated. Superseded by current docs.

### Files to Keep:

1. **`SYNC_CLEAR_FIX.md`** - ‚úÖ KEEP - Documents important empty field propagation fix (2025-10-07). Still valuable for historical reference and troubleshooting.

### Removal Command:
```bash
cd /Users/steffen/Documents/GitHub/Hangarplaner-1/debug
rm -f SYNC_ISSUE_FIX.md SYNC_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md MASTER_SLAVE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
```

## üîç Key Findings from Review

### Strengths Identified
1. **Production-ready code** - Well-architected multi-master system
2. **Sophisticated conflict resolution** - Optimistic locking + intelligent retry
3. **Real-time collaboration** - Presence-based locking with visual feedback
4. **Delta-only updates** - Minimizes bandwidth and conflicts
5. **Comprehensive error handling** - Timeouts, watchdogs, fallbacks

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Test coverage** - Need automated integration tests
2. **Configuration** - Hardcoded values should be externalized
3. **Logging** - Add structured logging for observability
4. **Performance monitoring** - Track metrics (sync duration, conflicts, etc.)
5. **Code duplication** - Some logic duplicated between sync-manager and sharing-manager

### Security Recommendations
1. **Session rotation** - Implement token refresh mechanism
2. **Rate limiting** - Add client-side throttling
3. **Input validation** - Schema-based field validation
4. **HTTPS enforcement** - Warn on insecure connections in production
